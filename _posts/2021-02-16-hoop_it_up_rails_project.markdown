Getting in to Rails has been exciting for me because I feel like I'm writing code similar to what I would actually be writing at a job. Don't get me wrong, I have enjoyed and appreciated everything leading up to this - I am a firm believer in learning (mostly) from the ground up so as to understand where you came from. It's just been a long journey to get to the point where this may be real-world-applicable coding.

When choosing my project idea, I did what I've done for all of my projects - stick to what I know. I'm an avid basketball player, and play a lot of pickup basketball with a fairly large group of rotating guys. It's usually organized on a massive text chain, but there are more guys than are able to be on one group text. I thought to myself, I could make a program that would make this easier.

And here we are.

Hoop It Up is relatively simple. Each player can log in, see all of the courts where people play (or add a new one), see all of the pickup games people have scheduled (or schedule a new one), see who's playing at each game, and see all the games that they have signed up for on their home page.

The biggest challenge for me has been third party authentication - omniauth. I have the rest of the app functioning as I want it to, just the final project requirement of getting omniauth to work. I've gone over all of the lessons about it, googled the errors I'm getting extensively, tried different providers (google, facebook, github), and still I'm banging my head against the wall. I imagine there's some small typo somewhere, or that I have a certain snippet of code in the wrong file, and suddenly it will all work, but until I find whatever is astray, omniauth is not my friend.

And with that, back in to the code I go to see if I can find the fix...
