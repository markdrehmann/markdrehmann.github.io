I did it. I wrote my first program that I thought of myself. Since I started this course, this was one of the biggest hurdles I could see, because whereas all of the lessons and labs can be challenging, it's all laid out in front of you and there are a ton of people to help in all sorts of ways. The CLI project was the first thing starting with a blank page, and that was daunting.

A couple of the biggest things I learned were that: A. It seems like in coding there will always be a ton of people willing to help with any project, all you have to do is ask (and know where to ask). And B. Having a plan is huge.

I watched a bunch of the instructional videos from Avi F. and other instructors just about how to begin and get the project set up, and the huge emphasis on planning (flow chart, to do lists, write the "answer" then write the code...) really helped me through. Once I had my idea for a project, everything else fell into place with only a few hiccups along the way (I didn't know you can't scrape 72 pages at once, for example).

My app scrapes a Green Bay Packers website to get the roster and information about each player. I thought the hardest part was going to be the scraping, as it was still fairy new to me, but once I got it together it actually went quickly. The longest part ended up being the actual interface with the user. I wanted to make sure it looked at least a little aesthetically pleasing (thank you colorize gem!) and wanted to make sure that the logic flow would always return the user to at least an acceptable place without any fatal errors or anything. It took a while, and if there's any re-factoring to be done, I'm sure it's in my logic flow, but I got it working how I wanted!

One last note about the whole project - I am very excited to set up my local environment. I understand why learn.co uses the in-browser IDE, and it definitely lets us get right into coding faster, but getting my own project set up in the in-browser IDE was a hassle, and then since it was in browser, certain things would make the page reload and I would lose all changes and have to repeat steps. It did make me learn to push my commits up to GitHub very frequently!
