Why did I decide to pursue coding? Valid question.

I'm in my mid-30s. I work for myself making and repairing musical instruments. Violin bows, to be precise. Fiddle sticks. There are a lot of rewarding aspects to being a bowmaker. I enjoy making things, specifically creating a tool for musicians can use, and a tool that can be viewed as a piece of artwork in itself. However, there are some drawbacks as well. I have a large workshop with a lot of specialized tools that contrasts with my desire to be minimal. It's an old craft that requires a fairly large amount of rare materials which are increasingly difficult to find. Also, it's a small niche market that I serve. I am relegated to serving musicians in my general area of the country, or those who are willing to ship things to me from further away.

So, with this in mind, I have been open to different opportunities, and computer programming presented itself.

Some of the things I enjoy about working for myself should continue to apply in a career in programming. I will be able to make tools for people to use - applications - and instead of being for a relatively small market of local musicians, what I code can be available to anyone with a computer or the internet. All I will need to work is a computer, which I can carry around with me whenever I'd like to be mobile. And with the amount of jobs these days that are flexible with working remotely or even from a long distance, there is still a large amount of flexibility that I hope to be able to maintain while transitioning out of working for myself.

Also, I've always loved computers. I like solving puzzles and working on problems until I understand them and from everyone I've talked to who's in the business, it sounds like that is a large part of the work. Patience in problem solving.

So, I'm about a month in to the Flatiron online program. I'm enjoying it a lot! It can be a bit frustrating at times, but it's also extremely fun to finish the labs and progress in my understanding of code. I know I'm still very much a novice, but I was proud to show my wife my "first application" which felt extremely complicated at the time, even though it was simply a lab in the curriculum where I programmed a simple version of tic tac toe. I'm sure I'll look back and laugh at the simplicity of it.

Anyway, I'm excited to be coding! And now, back to work!
