"Following the flow of logic" is a phrase I've heard a lot in lectures. It's something that I really like about coding. It's a chain of cause and effect with each link in the chain as important as the last, because each link gets you to the next link.

I'm in the midst of a career change, going from an old-world woodworking craft (bowmaking - as in violins), to a full-stack web developer. You would think that the two jobs couldn't be more different. One is at the forefront of technology, always learning the next language or developing the next feature... The other is a craft that has been handed down from generation to generation for over two centuries - sometimes the tools themselves are over 100 years old. However, I find myself always coming back to "the plan."

Any major bow repair takes a lot of careful planning. When you're working on old, expensive instruments, you can't just start in and hope the repair goes in the direction you want it to. Which part needs to be glued first? What old glue needs to be cleaned out? How do you clean it out, and will it cause other problems? Why was there glue there in the first place? One of my favorite anecdotes was of a co-worker making a small part that goes on the end of the bow called a "button." Bows are octagonal at the handle, and so the button (which starts round) is octagonal to match the end of the stick. My co-worker started filing down one side at a time, attempting to turn the button 1/8 around as he went. He finished it, put it on the stick, and the facets didn't line up. He had made a 7-sided button. The way to make a perfect octagon each time is to file 4 sides (in square-fashion), then knock off the 4 corners to make it 8. Easy plan, easy execution.

I have learned over the years to make sure to think ahead before starting any project. In woodworking, it's commonly referred to as "measure twice, cut once." So far in coding, this has served me well. Once you can picture the plan, all that's left is execution. It really is all about the plan.
