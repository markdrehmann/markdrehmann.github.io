Let's not kid ourselves, we're talking about JavaScript here. Yes, there is some HTML, and a dash of CSS, but a vast majority of the bells and whistles and function fall to JavaScript.

This blog post is dedicated to my JavaScript portfolio project. Like all my projects, coming up with an idea seems to be the biggest hurdle. Don't they say the hardest thing about writing is a blank page? Something like that. This project seemed particularly difficult to choose a subject because it seemed so very wide open.


Instructions: Create a page

Me: What does it have to do?

Instructions: Anything

Me: ...Could you narrow that down?

Instructions: ...No


That blank page is a blessing and a curse. Total freedom, but where to start? Since I was taking so long to try to think of an idea, I ended up keeping it simple and creating a To-Do list application. Now that I had a start, everything starts moving forward!

I did a few planning exercises outlined in the curriculum, which is excellent advice, and then got into the code. What I've learned about myself is that my initial planning is a good start, but it's usually terribly wrong. No problem! The biggest thing I learned on this project, is it's always great to go back to the drawing board. I literally take out a piece of paper and write down some logic flow for a specific thing I'm doing.

How is this function actually supposed to work? Where is the data coming from? What do I want this to return? How is the application handling all of these functions? Does any of this make sense?

These are all the questions I ask myself when I'm in the middle of a project and feel like I'm banging my head against the wall. But one by one, I answer the questions. Then one of the functions I write makes the next function make more sense, and the next, and the next, and all of a sudden the project is done.

It's really great at the end of a project to remember the blank page at the beginning, and see the fully-functioning application at the end, and realize that all that effort actually produced something!
